Airport MVC Application made in ASP.NET Core 6.0 MVC

For starting the application you need just to update the Local Database from SQL Server, which is implemented in Visual Studio IDE. The migration of the models is already created in the project.<br>
In Package Manager Console type: "Update-Database".

For using the application, there are already 2 users created: <br>
1. Admin role with credentials:<br>
  -Username: "admin@admin.com"<br>
  -Password: "Admin123"<br>
2. User role with credentials:<br>
  -Username: "user@user.com"<br>
  -Password: "User1234"<br>

Enjoy!
